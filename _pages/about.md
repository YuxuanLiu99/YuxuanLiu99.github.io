I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University, working with Professor [Shaolun Huang]( https://sites.google.com/view/slhuang/home). Prior to that, I received my M.Sc. (2024) degree with highest honors in Data Science and Information Technology from Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xinlei Chen]( https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ha8rlUgAAAAJ&hl=en).  I earned my B.E. (2021) degree in Communications Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University.

My current research mainly focuses on Distributed Learning, Information Theory and XAI. My previous work concentrated on large-scale and highly dynamic environmental sensing and mobile computing.
