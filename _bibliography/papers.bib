  abstract={Mobile air pollution sensing methods are developed to collect air quality data with higher spatial-temporal resolutions. However, existing methods cannot process the spatially mixed gas samples effectively due to the highly dynamic temporal and spatial fluctuations experienced by the sensor, leading to significant measurement deviations. We find an opportunity to tackle the problem by exploring the potential patterns from sensor measurements. In light of this, we propose MobiAir, a novel city-scale fine-grained air quality estimation system to deliver accurate mobile air quality data. First, we design AirBERT, a representation learning model to discern mixed gas concentrations. Second, we design a knowledge-informed training strategy leveraging massive unlabeled city-scale data to enhance the AirBERT performance. To ensure the practicality of MobiAir, we have invested significant efforts in implementing the software stack on our meticulously crafted Sensing Front-end, which has successfully gathered air quality data at a city-scale for more than 1200 hours. Experiments conducted on collected data show that MobiAir reduces sensing errors by 96.7% with only 44.9ms latency, outperforming the SOTA baseline by 39.5%.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
