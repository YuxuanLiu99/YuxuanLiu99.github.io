  abstract={Mobile air pollution sensing methods are developed to collect air quality data with higher spatial-temporal resolutions. However, existing methods cannot process the spatially mixed gas samples effectively due to the highly dynamic temporal and spatial fluctuations experienced by the sensor, leading to significant measurement deviations. We find an opportunity to tackle the problem by exploring the potential patterns from sensor measurements. In light of this, we propose MobiAir, a novel city-scale fine-grained air quality estimation system to deliver accurate mobile air quality data. First, we design AirBERT, a representation learning model to discern mixed gas concentrations. Second, we design a knowledge-informed training strategy leveraging massive unlabeled city-scale data to enhance the AirBERT performance. To ensure the practicality of MobiAir, we have invested significant efforts in implementing the software stack on our meticulously crafted Sensing Front-end, which has successfully gathered air quality data at a city-scale for more than 1200 hours. Experiments conducted on collected data show that MobiAir reduces sensing errors by 96.7% with only 44.9ms latency, outperforming the SOTA baseline by 39.5%.},

  abstract={Fine-grained air pollution data is essential for smart living and efficient city management. However, it is arduous to obtain accurate air pollution data with high spatial and temporal resolutions via mobile crowdsensing (MCS) under limited budgets. Thus, we propose FAD, a system fully using fine-grained air pollution data to provide diverse services. Moreover, a low-cost yet highly accurate portable sensing device is designed for MCS applications to enhance data resolutions. Finally, we demonstrate various FAD-based services for citizens and governments in the real world.},

  abstract={CO2 concentration data with high resolution in large venues is highly required during indoor sport events for in-time environment adjustment to guarantee the athlete performances and audience experience. However, the limited battery energy of the wireless sensors cannot support high data resolution and long time coverage simultaneously. Besides, there also lacks effective embedded methods to clean anomaly data caused by the human and environmental factors probably occurring in large venues. Thus, in this paper, we propose C-RIDGE, a low-power sensing system for high resolution CO2 data collection in large venues. Based on prior knowledge, firstly, an adaptive sampling rate adjustment policy is developed for lower energy consumption to extend the time coverage of data. Secondly, CO2 physical property (CPP) aided data cleaning algorithm is designed to improve data quality as well, using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and standard deviation with sliding windows. C-RIDGE has been deployed in one venue during a world-class event. The experiments and collected data have shown the system power consumption can be reduced by 36.1%, with measurement error less than 10.2%. The outliers and anomaly trends can also be detected and calibrated effectively via CPP algorithm. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7160830.},

  abstract={Accurate calibration of low-cost sensors is critical for improving their potential in environmental monitoring. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on supervised learning commonly calibrate sensor measurements with ground truth from the immediate past or future. However, these techniques rely heavily on labeled data which is challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios. Thus, this paper introduces CaliFormer, a novel representation learning model using self-supervised learning to extract time- and spatial-invariant knowledge from unlabeled measurements. Moreover, we propose pre-training enhancements and model architecture modifications to help train CaliFormer. We then fine-tune the calibration model with the learned representations, which is supervised by limited labeled data. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate our calibration model with a dataset collected by low-cost sensors. Results show that our model outperforms other SOTA calibration methods significantly.}

  abstract={As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become more prevalent in smart cities, their capacity for visual language navigation (VLN) is garnering increasing interest. VLN in cities has significant applications in delivery, rescue, and security patrol, among other fields. One of the most representative tasks is to navigate to specific locations following the language instructions. While some current methods have achieved notable results in indoor settings, challenges persist outdoors, including agents’ inaccurate spatial understanding and ambiguous language instructions. In this work, we explore an embodied navigation agent design, in which a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory are proposed to guarantee accurate VLN in open 3D urban environments.}

The ideal HMI for the metaverse should be cheap, robust, customizable, and ergonomically friendly. In light of this, we propose a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-based sensing system. We developed a low-cost, soft, light, and customizable TENG sensor to collect data from the human body. We then used an artificial neural network (ANN) to obtain the corresponding human motion from collected sensory data. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated with experiments of a working prototype.}

  abstract={Delivery drones provide a promising sensing platform for smart cities thanks to their city-wide infrastructure and large-scale deployment. However, due to limited battery lifetime and available resources, it is challenging to schedule delivery drones to derive both high sensing and delivery performance, which is a highly complicated optimization problem with several coupled decision variables. Meanwhile, this complex optimization problem involves multiple interconnected decision variables, making it even more complex. In this paper, we first propose a delivery drone-based sensing system and formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP) that jointly optimizes the sensing utility and delivery time, considering practical factors including energy capacity and available delivery drones. Then we provide an efficient solution that integrates the strength of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and heuristic, which decouples the highly complicated optimization search process and replaces the heavy computation with a rapid approximation. Evaluation results compared with the state-of-the-art baselines show that DDL improves the scheduling quality by at least 46% on average. More importantly, our proposed method could effectively improve the computational efficiency, which is up to 98 times higher than the best baseline.}

  abstract={MAV (Micro Aerial Vehicle) requires landing on a docking platform for recharging during or after missions due to their limited energy capacity. Inspired by biological tactile sensing, we propose a proprioceptive sensing system that allows MAV to "touch", recognize, and locate the landing platform even when visual or other positioning systems are not functioning properly. We leverage a physical phenomenon: as the MAV approaches a beneath obstacle, it experiences attitude disturbances caused by the airflow generated by the rotor’s reflections from the ground. By employing traditional signal processing and learning-based techniques to analyze signals from the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and motors, the MAV can sense the edges of the platform and further calculate the precise landing coordinates. With a power consumption of less than 40 mW, our system achieves an edge detection error of less than 2 cm and a landing success rate exceeding 90%.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
